In each set of figures, the individual panels show the cost profiles split by different components.

For example, in the "IRI freq.pdf" file, we see the relationships between the IRI frequency composition cost and the model parameters. Each column shows the profiles for one component from 1:27, 1:9, 1:3, 1:1, ..., 27:1 from left to right.
